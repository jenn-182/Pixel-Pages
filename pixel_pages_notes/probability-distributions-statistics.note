# Probability Distributions - Chapter 6

## Random Variables
### Definition
A function that assigns numerical values to outcomes of a random experiment.

### Types
- **Discrete**: Countable outcomes (dice roll, coin flip)
- **Continuous**: Uncountable outcomes (height, weight, time)

## Discrete Probability Distributions

### Binomial Distribution  
Models number of successes in n independent trials.
- Parameters: n (trials), p (success probability)
- Formula: P(X = k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)

### Example
Probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips:
P(X = 3) = C(5,3) × (0.5)³ × (0.5)² = 10 × 0.125 × 0.25 = 0.3125

## Continuous Distributions

### Normal Distribution
- Bell-shaped curve
- Parameters: μ (mean), σ (standard deviation)  
- 68-95-99.7 rule
- Standard normal: μ = 0, σ = 1

### Applications
- Test scores
- Heights and weights
- Measurement errors

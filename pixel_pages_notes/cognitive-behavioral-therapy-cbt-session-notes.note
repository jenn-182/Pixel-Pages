## Overview
**Date:** October 15, 2024  
**Topic:** Introduction to CBT Principles  
**Professor:** Dr. Sarah Martinez  

## Key Concepts

### The Cognitive Triangle
The **cognitive triangle** demonstrates the interconnected relationship between:
- **Thoughts** (cognitions)
- **Feelings** (emotions) 
- **Behaviors** (actions)

> *"Our thoughts influence our feelings, which in turn influence our behaviors, creating a continuous cycle."*

### Core Principles of CBT

1. **Present-focused approach**
   - Concentrates on current problems rather than past events
   - Emphasizes *here and now* solutions

2. **Collaborative relationship**
   - Therapist and client work as a team
   - Client is viewed as the expert on their own experience

3. **Goal-oriented therapy**
   - ==Specific, measurable objectives==
   - Time-limited treatment approach

## Cognitive Distortions

Common patterns of **negative thinking**:

- **All-or-nothing thinking**: Seeing situations in black and white
- **Catastrophizing**: Expecting the worst possible outcome
- **Mind reading**: Assuming you know what others are thinking
- **Emotional reasoning**: *"I feel it, therefore it must be true"*

## Techniques & Interventions

### Thought Records
A structured way to examine automatic thoughts:

| Situation | Automatic Thought | Emotion | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Balanced Thought |

| Failed exam | "I'm stupid" | Shame (8/10) | Got low grade | Studied hard, other good grades | "This was difficult material, I can improve" |

### Behavioral Experiments
- Test the validity of negative predictions
- Gather evidence to challenge unhelpful beliefs
- `Hypothesis → Prediction → Experiment → Results → Conclusion`

## Clinical Applications

CBT is **evidence-based** for treating:
- Depression
- Anxiety disorders
- PTSD
- Eating disorders
- Substance abuse

## Research Notes

**Effectiveness rates:**
- 60-80% improvement in depression symptoms
- Comparable to medication for many conditions
- Lower relapse rates than medication alone

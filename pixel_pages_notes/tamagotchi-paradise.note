A Zoom Dial lets you physically switch views from your entire planet down to a microscopic look at your Tamagotchi's cells.

You are the ruler of a planet, not just the owner of a single pet. Your goal is to grow the population.

The game features over 50 characters and 50,000 possible variations. Your care and environment directly influence your Tamagotchi's appearance.

Devices connect via a physical docking port to breed characters and unlock other interactions.

A new Tama Lab feature allows you to connect to in-store displays for exclusive items and use sticker codes for gameplay hints.

The game is built around missions and leveling up your planet to unlock new areas and content.

It is powered by two AAA batteries, a change from the rechargeable battery of the previous model.

The Lab Mode includes mini-games, a shop for in-game items, and a compendium to track your progress.

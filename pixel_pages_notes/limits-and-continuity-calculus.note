# Limits and Continuity - Chapter 2

## Definition of a Limit
The limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L if we can make f(x) arbitrarily close to L by taking x sufficiently close to a.

### Mathematical Notation
lim(x→a) f(x) = L

## Types of Limits
1. **One-sided limits**
   - Left-hand limit: lim(x→a⁻) f(x)
   - Right-hand limit: lim(x→a⁺) f(x)

2. **Two-sided limits** 
   - Exists only if left and right limits are equal

## Continuity
A function f is continuous at x = a if:
- f(a) is defined
- lim(x→a) f(x) exists  
- lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a)

### Examples Worked in Class
1. f(x) = x² + 3x - 2, find lim(x→1) f(x)
2. Piecewise function continuity check

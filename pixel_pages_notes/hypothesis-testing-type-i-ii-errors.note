## The Setup
- **H₀ (Null)**: No effect, status quo, ==what we assume is true==
- **H₁ (Alternative)**: What we're trying to prove
- **α (Alpha)**: Significance level (usually 0.05)
- **p-value**: Probability of observing data if H₀ is true

## Decision Making
- If p-value < α → **Reject H₀**
- If p-value ≥ α → **Fail to reject H₀**

> Never say "accept H₀" - we only fail to reject it!

## Types of Errors

### Type I Error (α)
- **False Positive** - rejecting true H₀
- "Convicting an innocent person"
- Probability = α = 0.05

### Type II Error (β)  
- **False Negative** - failing to reject false H₀
- "Letting a guilty person go free"
- Power = 1 - β = *probability of correctly rejecting false H₀*

## Example from Class
**Research Question**: Does new drug reduce blood pressure?

- H₀: μ_drug = μ_placebo (no difference)
- H₁: μ_drug < μ_placebo (drug works)
- n = 100, x̄ = 145, s = 12, μ₀ = 150
- **Result**: p = 0.032 < 0.05 → ==Reject H₀==

## Homework Problems
- Chapter 9: #15, 23, 31, 45
- ==Practice interpreting p-values in context==
